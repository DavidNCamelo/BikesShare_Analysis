# BikesShare_Analysis
This is a data treatment about a business case of a Public Bikeshare company in California USA. I realized to solve something that wasn't possible to do in Power BI directly

The business Cases calculate the Net Rate (defined as trips ended minus trips started at the station for a given hour) for all stations in the Bay Area this was the main challenge that I couldn't solve on the PBI. In this repository, there is the final solution for this concept.

Also here is a visual generated on PBI: https://project.novypro.com/CPsW3r
